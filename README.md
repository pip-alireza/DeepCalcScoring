This is the offial page for the paper "Automated Measurement of Vascular Calcification in Femoral Endarterectomy Patients using Deep Learning". 

This project leverages deep learning to automatically extract the vascular system in CT images of the human body and measure the calcium content in lower extremities, achieving #SOTA performance. This work enables monitoring calcification in the vascular system and detecting any atherosclerosis related condition which could potentially lead to heart attack or even leg amputation.
