This is the offial page for the paper "Automated Measurement of Vascular Calcification in Femoral Endarterectomy Patients using Deep Learning". This page is under work and will be updated soon.

The goal of this project is to quantify calcification in human CT images. The below picture shows the workflow of the proposed model for quantifying calcification in human CT images. The deep learning
model automatically segments the vascular system, which is then overlayed on the input image. Subsequent intensity thresholding identifies calcification within the vascular system. Finally, the cumulative calcification score is obtained by aggregating individual calcifications, and a conversion factor is applied to measure calcification volume. The code will be available upon publication.
